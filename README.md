# Source Engine Maps

![SourceEngine-MAP_BANNER](https://github.com/VoxAndrews/Source-Engine-Maps/assets/26544407/ffb38a59-3c9a-4bad-a42f-d9c8ecf23d77)

## What is this?
This is a collection of maps that I have made inside of the Source Engine. In this repository you will find the Valve Map File (VMF) as well as a VMX (Backup of the VMF) of many different maps that I have either completed, scrapped, or are currently in development. These are free to download by anyone under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/ "GNU General Public License v3.0"), and you can edit and redistribute them to your hearts content, as long as you keep them under the same licence and open source. And where you don't need to attribute this repository, any attributions of these original files if being used would be greatly appreciated, and I would love to see the different things people make with these files.

## I have the VMF, but what about the assets?
Because I haven't made a lot of these assets and have instead used them from different sources, I didn't want to include them in fear of people getting confused that I was taking credit for them, as well as the fact that they may have blown out the size of this repository. So instead, I will be updating the Wiki on this repository to store a list of assets and games (If the map pulls assets from other games) that are required for each map, so you can obtain them yourself.

## Why don't you include a pre-compiled BSP?
Same reason as the assets, I don't want to blow out the size of the repository, but it's not too difficult for you to do it yourself using the Hammer Editor, and there are plenty of tutorials out there.

## Hammer or Hammer++?
I don't personally know if the version of hammer you use will affect if these files open or not, but all of the ones in here were built using [Hammer++](https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/ "Hammer++ Homepage"), so if there are compatability issues, use that. Even if you don't have compatability issues with either, I recommend still using Hammer++ as it has a bunch of features and modifications that will make your life in Source Engine mapping that little less painful.

## What games are these maps for?
When stated in the Wiki, each map will include the game it was originally made for.
